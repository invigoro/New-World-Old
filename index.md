# Player's Guide

## Basic Mechanics 


### Actions

During gameplay, each character has actions they can take. There is no specific criteria for what constitutes an action, but generally they’ll fall into the categories of investigating a situation, manipulating someone, fighting, or using magic. Whenever a player takes an action, they state what they intend to do and the effect they hope for. In general, the character will then be able to simply do the action. However, if it is not something easy and simple, the GM may ask the player to roll for a **characteristic** in order to determine if the character is successful. 


### Player Characteristics

Each of these core characteristics determines the physical and mental makeup of your character. These can range from 0 to 8, with a higher score representing a greater aptitude for that characteristic. When creating a character, assign two of these characteristics a value of 0, three of them a value of 2, two of them a value of 4, and one a value of 6. You will have the option to increase these scores later.


#### Endurance

Physical health and endurance. Used for checks involving physical strain over long periods of time or for checks involving the overall health of your body.


#### Strength

Physical raw strength. Used for checks requiring a character to use brute force, anaerobic athletics, and for most melee attacks.


#### Coordination

Physical nimbleness and dexterity. Used for checks involving quickness, gracefulness, stealth, precision, and finesse.


#### Knowledge

Acquired knowledge and wisdom. Used for checks to recall history, lore, culture, and geography. 


#### Cunning

Cleverness and wit. Used for checks involving problem-solving, investigating, reading a situation, trickery, and tactical planning.


#### Instinct

Innate wisdom. Used for checks that involve discerning or doing things without logic or prior knowledge.


#### Resolve

Mental toughness and level-headedness. Used for any checks to sway your commitment and resist the mental effects of magic as well as to act under pressure.


#### Diplomacy

The general ability to deal with interpersonal relationships. Used for any checks that might involve persuasion, deception, intimidation, or distraction.


### Making a Check

In general, when a character attempts to take an **action**, they won’t need to roll. This is because most actions taken during a game will likely not be difficult to accomplish for the average person (or they may not be possible). However, when a character tries to do something particularly challenging, a check may be required. The standard **characteristic die **for this is a 20-sided die. 

When a check is required by the GM, the player rolls their characteristic die and adds the relevant score. For example, if a player says “I jump into the river and try to swim upstream,” the GM may require a Strength check in order to determine if the character is successful in their action. The player then rolls a d20 and adds their relevant characteristic score to the roll, which in this case is their Strength score. 

There is also the possibility that the player has a **feature** that would cause them to be able to use a **proficiency** in this situation. In the previous example, the _Swimmer I_ feature would be applicable. If the player has this proficiency, then they can roll two characteristic dice and choose the higher score of the two for the final result.

Similarly, if they have an **expertise**, they can roll three characteristic dice and choose the highest.

Lastly, the particularities of a situation may impose **advantage** or **disadvantage** on a roll. If a particularly advantageous situation arises, you may be allowed to roll advantage, which means that the number of total dice is increased by 1, the result is the highest value. Disadvantage will result in one fewer die in the total. If there is only one die to begin with, roll 2 die and take the lowest as the result.

There are five possible results of the final roll:



*   If either the die roll or the total value of the roll is 1, the attempt is a miserable failure in the worst possible way. The character does not complete the intended action and will have a detrimental consequence. However, the character learns from their mistakes and gains an **experience point.**
*   If the total roll is between 2 and 8, the character fails their attempt. There’s a negative side effect dependent on the situation and determined by the GM. However, the character learns from their mistakes and gains an **experience point.**
*   If the total roll is between 9 and 15, the attempt is a mixed success. You succeed in what you’re doing, but there’s a negative side effect, or there’s a stipulation required for success. 
*   If the total roll is 16 or higher, the attempt is a complete success. 
*   Regardless of the total number, if the die roll is 20, then this is a **critical success**. Otherwise, it’s a normal success. On a critical success, however, the attempt is a complete success in the best way possible, and there may be some other helpful side effect dependent on the action and situation and determined by the GM.

Sometimes, a character might try to help out another character when they’re attempting an action. In this case, the character attempting the action must make a roll as described above. The character helping must make a roll, applying the appropriate** characteristic score** and any proficiencies/expertise that fit with how they’re attempting to help. There are five possible results of this roll, and they all will be with respect to the characteristic score of the character who is helping: 



*   If either the die roll or the total value of the roll is 1, the attempt is a miserable failure in the worst possible way. The character being helped must subtract the helper’s characteristic score from their total roll. However, the character who is helping learns from their mistakes and gains an **experience point.**
*   If the total roll is between 2 and 8, the character fails their attempt. The character being helped must subtract half of the characteristic score from their total roll. However, the character learns from their mistakes and gains an **experience point.**
*   If the total roll is between 9 and 15, the attempt is a mixed success. The character receiving help can add half of the characteristic score to their total roll. 
*   If the total roll is 16 or higher, the attempt is a complete success The character being helped can add the value of the characteristic score to their total roll. 
*   Regardless of the total number, if the die roll is 20, then this is a **critical success**. The character receiving help can add twice the characteristic score to their total roll.

In some situations where a being is actively trying to do something to a player character and the player character is actively attempting to resist or avoid this from happening, a **contest **occurs. In this situation, both members of the contest need to roll for what they’re attempting to do. For example, when a magician tries to lull someone to sleep with magic, they must roll for the effectiveness of their magic. If the subject actively resists, they can make a resolve check to stay awake. The results of a check such as this are as follows:



*   If the either the die roll or the total value of the roll is 1, the attempt is a miserable failure in the worst possible way. Rather than resisting someone’s action against you, you actively aid in their efforts. However, you learn from your mistake and gain an **experience point.**
*   If the total roll is between 2 and 8, there is no effect on the result of the opponent’s roll. However, you learn from your mistake and gain an **experience point**. 
*   If the total roll is between 9 and 15, the attempt is a mixed success. You are able to mitigate some of the effects by reducing the damage done, delaying the result, etc.
*   If the total roll is 16 or higher, the results of the opponent’s roll are reduced by one category, i.e. a failure becomes a critical failure, a mixed success becomes a failure, a complete success becomes a mixed success, a critical success becomes a complete success.
*   On a critical success, the effect is completely mitigated and the opponent’s roll becomes a critical failure, unless it was originally a critical success, in which case it only becomes a failure.

If two or more characters are simply competing for the same thing (a foot race, for example) each makes a relevant roll and the highest total roll wins. If there is a tie for the winner, all who tied must re-roll.

Whenever a player gets a roll they don’t like, they can choose to expend an **experience point** to change the value of the roll to 12. This does not, however, allow for the possibility of a critical success.

### Experience Points

As characters gain experience doing things throughout the game, this experience will be represented in earned **experience points**. For example, whenever a character has a **critical failure** on a roll, they learn from the mistake and earn one experience point. The GM should award experience points throughout the game in other ways, some of which are:



*   A character solves a problem using a particularly creative solution
*   A player role-plays their character extremely well
*   A character takes actions that advance the story in a new and interesting way
*   A character completes a significant milestone or narrative arc

At the end of every session, players will be able to spend their experience points on **features** listed in the Features section, which will grant them particular abilities, proficiencies, and expertise.


### Combat

In any action-oriented roleplaying game, combat is bound to happen. Though combat doesn’t have to follow these rules, they’re here in case things start to get messy.


#### Turns

Hopefully for most of the game, taking turns fairly and deciding the order of turns won’t be too much of a problem. However, during combat, this may become more difficult. In order to prevent this, combat should be broken up into **rounds**, where each round lets every party involved take one **turn**. The parties can be individual players, ships, platoons of soldiers, herds of beasts, or even vast armies. Each party’s turn should consist of a full action, though longer actions such as casting a large spell may take longer than one turn. Prior to the round beginning, every party must state the action they will take the intended result. The order of combat is then determined by an **initiative roll**: each person rolls a d20 and adds either their Coordination or their Cunning score, whichever is higher. The players than take turns in descending order of that initiative roll; each player describes how they go about taking their action and then rolls for effectiveness if required. At the end of the round, everyone again states their next actions and then makes another roll to determine the order for the next round.


#### Attacking

During combat, an action can be to simply attack. Just like with checks, attacks require rolling a characteristic die to see if they’re successful. Depending on the weapon and the way it’s used, this can call for a different characteristic score to be added to the roll. Magic uses in combat, however, always use their predefined characteristics. On a success, damage will be dealt to whomever the target is. 

If you’re holding two weapons, you can attack with each one in a single turn. However, you’ll only be able to add a characteristic score and any proficiency/expertise to one of the rolls rather than both. This also applies to unarmed attacks.

Some schools of magic allow you to deal damage to an opponent. In this case, you’ll be making an attack roll against them and adding the characteristic score that applies to that school of magic. If the roll total is above their **defense**, then the appropriate damage is dealt.


#### Defense

Whenever you fight, there’s a good chance that you’ll get hit at least a few times. How frequently you get hit is determined by your **defense**, which is calculated from a few factors. In order for an attack to hit you, the roll has to be higher than your defense. For example, if your defense is 11, a roll of 1-11 does not hit. However, 12 or higher does, and damage will be dealt. 

Your defense is calculated from several factors. Beginning at character creation, your defense is 10. Then, add the average value of your **Coordination** and **Instinct**. For example, if your Coordination is 5 and your Instinct is 2, your defense will be 13.5, and any attack roll higher than 13.5 will hit. 

Magical effects such as spells and enchantments may boost your defense temporarily. Additionally, wearing armor won’t add to your defense, though it will reduce the amount of damage taken. Be careful not to wear armor too high of a weight cost, as it will slow you down and lower your defense, even if it absorbs damage!


#### Armor


##### General Armor

While armor won’t stop someone from hitting you, it may help absorb some of the damage it does. If the armor is capable of blocking the type of damage received (e.g. armor against fire can block fire damage) then the armor’s value is subtracted from the amount of damage. For example, say that a sword strike deals 5 damage to a player. However, the player has 2 armor that is effective against that sort of damage. The damage is then reduced to 3 by the armor.

In regards to actually wearing armor, plate and chainmail have become quite uncommon as a means of protection, though there are still some who wear them. This is primarily due to the fact that heavy armor does almost nothing to mitigate the damage that firearms can do, so in a firefight all it really does is serve to slow down the wearer. Not only is wearing heavy armor impractical, but it is simply impolite in most social scenarios.

When wearing armor, the effectiveness is determined by three characteristic scores: Endurance, Strength, and Coordination. Each armor item (examples are given in the table below) should have two values: a **weight cost **and a** rating**. When choosing a piece of armor, take the average of your Strength and Endurance. This will determine how effective the armor is. Next, choose the armor your character is wearing and find the cost. Subtract this from the average you calculated. If the weight cost is less than or equal to the average, simply add the armor rating to your character’s general armor. If it is greater than the average, the difference between the two will be subtracted from your **defense **score while you are wearing the armor. This subtraction can drop the score below zero if the armor cost is high enough.

As an example, suppose your character has a **Strength **of 6 and an **Endurance** of 5. The average of the two scores is 5.5. If your character chooses to wear chain mail, the weight cost of that piece of armor is 5. Since 5 is less than or equal to 5.5, your character is able to simply add the armor’s rating to their general armor (+3). If your character chose to wear scaled armor, the weight cost would be 6. Since 6 is greater than 5.5, take the difference of 5.5 - 6, which equals -0.5. While the character is still able to add the full armor rating (+4) to their general armor, their defence will be decreased by 0.5 while they’re wearing it.

##### Armor against Magic

When you take damage from a magical effect, rather than using the physical armor you’re wearing, you’ll be able to subtract a relevant characteristic score from the damage. The characteristic score to apply is the one that matches the school of magic being used. For example, if you’re attacked by a spell from the Strife school of magic, you’ll be able to subtract your Strength from the damage. Essentially, this means that strength-based magic is weak against characters with high strength.


#### Weapons

Different weapons will deal different amounts of damage and utilize different characteristics for different types of attacks depending on the situation. All of them use a **damage die **roll** **to determine their effectiveness. In general, the damage die range from 4-sided to 12-sided. Additionally, each weapon will have different properties that put constraints on its use.

##### Weapon Properties



*   Slow: This weapon requires a longer time between each attack. Reloading weapons with this property require an action to reload.
*   Reloading: After each attack, the weapon must be reloaded, which can be challenging when in the middle of combat. Additionally, you’ll need to have a free hand to reload a weapon with this property. 
*   Long-range: Has higher accuracy than other ranged weapons and allows for precision at longer distances.
*   Loud: May draw attention when used.
*   Two-handed: Requires both hands to use.
*   Versatile: This weapon can be used as a ranged or melee weapon.
*   Reach: This weapon can reach past defenses and doesn’t require a person to get within range of their enemies non-reach weapons.
*   Complex: Requires multiple people to operate.


#### Health

Whenever a character takes damage, whether or not it’s in combat, it’s gonna hurt. **Health** is a numeric value that is used to keep track of injuries received by a character. Every character has a health maximum (new characters start at 15), which their health can’t go above. Players can spend experience points in order to increase this maximum. When a character takes damage, the damage is subtracted from their current health. Taking damage may also have one or more additional side effects:



*   Minor effect
    *   Drop something
    *   Momentarily inhibited
    *   Subtract 1 from next roll
*   Moderate effects
    *   Fall down
    *   Cannot take an action for 1 round
    *   Intense pain
*   Major effect
    *   Inability to use an injured body part
    *   Loss of consciousness
    *   Unstable wound or blood loss
*   Detrimental effect
    *   Permanent injury
    *   Maximum health decreased
    *   Loss of body part

If a character drops below 0 health, they are incapacitated, which means that they can’t make attacks or cast spells, and attempting to take any action first requires a **Resolve** check. If a character reaches -15 health, they die.

A character can heal a number of ways: seeking medical attention, magical healing, and slow recovery (automatically regaining 2 health per day).

#### Using Magic

When casting a spell, choose one of the effects that you have learned from a school of magic (see _School of Magic_ feature in the _Making a Character_ section). Then, roll your ability dice and add the score for the relevant characteristic (e.g. when casting a Trickery spell, add your Cunning score). 

There are five possible results of the final roll:



*   If either the die roll or the total value of the roll is 1, the character does not cast the spell and loses their connection to their magical source, which they regain automatically in 24 hours. However, the character learns from their mistake and gains an **experience point.**
*   If the total roll is between 2 and 8, the character fails their attempt. They lose control of the magic, with the effect determined by the GM. However, the character learns from their mistake and gains an **experience point.**
*   If the total roll is between 9 and 15, the attempt is a mixed success. You cast the spell, but there will be a negative effect associated with it (see list below).
*   If the total roll is 16 or higher, the attempt is a complete success You’re able to cast the spell as intended.
*   Regardless of the total number, if the die roll is 20, then this is a **critical success**. Otherwise, it’s a normal success. On a critical success, there will be a positive effect associated with it (see list below). 

Negative Effects



*   The effect is weakened by approximately half
*   The effect is of short duration
*   You take half the harm of the spell
*   The magic draws immediate, unwelcome attention
*   It has a problematic side effect
*   You unintentionally cast a different spell instead

Positive  Effects



*   The effect’s strength is doubled
*   The spell has a larger range or area of effect
*   The spell lasts for an additional number of turns equal to your relevant characteristic score
*   The damage the spell does is doubled
*   The number of beings affected is increased
*   An unintended, beneficial side effect happens
*   You’re able to cast an additional spell. Pick an effect from the same as the spell you’re casting from. The effect must be from a feature with a number less than or equal to the feature’s number you’re trying to cast from (e.g. if the spell you’re trying to cast comes from Combustion III, you can pick from Combustion I, II, or III, but not IV or V). 

In general, spells will have a maximum range of around 100 feet, only affect one being at a time, and last for at most for one turn (or, outside of combat, around 10 seconds - 1 minute, depending on the spell and situation). However, if you’d like to cast a spell that exceeds these bounds, you may be asked to make a check--such as re-rolling for your spell to continue casting for each subsequent turn--or use **Cosmic Magic** instead (see section below). Additionally, you won’t be able to cast more than one spell at once unless there’s something explicitly stating that you can do so.


#### Cosmic Magic

The use of magic involves tapping into the abundant, ubiquitous energy of the universe. While a small portion of the applications for this have been studied and perfected into common use, most of the potential for cosmic energy is uncharted territory. Some even say that there is no upper limit to the energy of the universe and that theoretically, anything is possible with magic given enough time and resources put into a spell.

If you want to perform an act of magic that goes further than the uses outlined in the _Player’s Guide_, use these rules for cosmic magic.

First, say what magical effect you want to make happen. This should still keep in mind the type of magic you’re trying to use. 

The GM will determine what you need to do for this magic spell or if it’s even possible for your character. The GM picks some of these and may add additional requirements as necessary:



*   You need to spend a lot of time (days or weeks) researching the magic ritual
*   You need to experiment with the spell--there will be lots of failures before you get it right
*   You need some rare and weird ingredients and supplies
*   The spell will take a long time (hours or days) to cast
*   You need a lot of people (2, 3, 7, 13, or more) to help
*   The spell needs to be cast at a particular place and/or time

Once the GM has specified the requirements, you just need to make them happen and the magic will go ahead. There’s no specific roll for making cosmic magic work, but you might need to succeed on some other rolls in the process, particularly one of the basic **use magic** rolls. 

Of course, magic is always perilous and cosmic magic is way more perilous than normal magic. The side effects and dangers of cosmic magic are at the GM’s discretion.

Additionally, due to the very nature of cosmic magic--being the magic that isn’t yet understood--you’ll never be able to roll with proficiency or expertise when using it. However, there’s a chance that your understanding of magic will grow by using this, and that a new magical effect will be added to the list of known spells.


## Making a Character

When making a character, you’ll need to pick a class and then make some choices based on your decision. No matter what you pick, you’ll have plenty of questions to answer in order to determine who your character is, what they want, and what they’re willing to do to get it.


### Classes

Unlike many other role-playing systems, classes in this are very loosely defined. You’ll get some starting features, perhaps some experience points to spend on other features, and discounts on particular features that you can choose in the future. These discounts help to guide you on a specific path that is suited for that archetype of character, but don’t force you to go that route if you choose not to. Similarly, the questions to consider are suggestions in order to help the creative process, not requirements.
