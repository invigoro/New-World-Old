/h2><p class=3D"c3"><span>In general, when a character attempts to take an =
</span><span class=3D"c1">action</span><span>, they won&rsquo;t need to rol=
l. This is because most actions taken during a game will likely not be diff=
icult to accomplish for the average person (or they may not be possible). H=
owever, when a character tries to do something particularly challenging, a =
check may be required. The standard </span><span class=3D"c1">characteristi=
c die </span><span class=3D"c0">for this is a 20-sided die. </span></p><p c=
lass=3D"c3 c19"><span class=3D"c0"></span></p><p class=3D"c3"><span class=
=3D"c0">When a check is required by the GM, the player rolls their characte=
ristic die and adds the relevant score. For example, if a player says &ldqu=
o;I jump into the river and try to swim upstream,&rdquo; the GM may require=
 a Strength check in order to determine if the character is successful in t=
heir action. The player then rolls a d20 and adds their relevant characteri=
stic score to the roll, which in this case is their Strength score. </span>=
</p><p class=3D"c3"><span>There is also the possibility that the player has=
 a </span><span class=3D"c1">feature</span><span>&nbsp;that would cause the=
m to be able to use a </span><span class=3D"c1">proficiency</span><span>&nb=
sp;in this situation. In the previous example, the </span><span class=3D"c2=
6">Swimmer I</span><span class=3D"c0">&nbsp;feature would be applicable. If=
 the player has this proficiency, then they can roll two characteristic dic=
e and choose the higher score of the two for the final result.</span></p><p=
 class=3D"c3"><span>Similarly, if they have an </span><span class=3D"c1">ex=
pertise</span><span class=3D"c0">, they can roll three characteristic dice =
and choose the highest.</span></p><p class=3D"c3"><span>Lastly, the particu=

n><span>&nbsp;or </span><span class=3D"c1">disadvantage</span><span class=

ou may be allowed to roll advantage, which means that the number of total d=
ice is increased by 1, the result is the highest value. Disadvantage will r=
esult in one fewer die in the total. If there is only one die to begin with=

s turn should consist of a full action, though longer actions such as casti=

Attacking</span></h3><p class=3D"c3"><span class=3D"c0">During combat, an a=
ction can be to simply attack. Just like with checks, attacks require rolli=

eristic score to be added to the roll. Magic uses in combat, however, alway=
s use their predefined characteristics. On a success, damage will be dealt =

 is determined by your </span><span class=3D"c1">defense</span><span class=

 hit you, the roll has to be higher than your defense. For example, if your=

two values: a </span><span class=3D"c1">weight cost </span><span>and a</spa=
n><span class=3D"c1">&nbsp;rating</span><span>. When choosing a piece of ar=
mor, take the average of your Strength and Endurance. This will determine h=
ow effective the armor is. Next, choose the armor your character is wearing=
 and find the cost. Subtract this from the average you calculated. If the w=
eight cost is less than or equal to the average, simply add the armor ratin=
g to your character&rsquo;s general armor. If it is greater than the averag=
e, the difference between the two will be subtracted from your </span><span=
 class=3D"c1">defense </span><span class=3D"c0">score while you are wearing=
 the armor. This subtraction can drop the score below zero if the armor cos=
t is high enough.</span></p><p class=3D"c3 c19"><span class=3D"c0"></span><=
/p><p class=3D"c3"><span>As an example, suppose your character has a </span=
><span class=3D"c1">Strength </span><span>of 6 and an </span><span class=3D=
"c1">Endurance</span><span class=3D"c0">&nbsp;of 5. The average of the two =
scores is 5.5. If your character chooses to wear chain mail, the weight cos=
t of that piece of armor is 5. Since 5 is less than or equal to 5.5, your c=
haracter is able to simply add the armor&rsquo;s rating to their general ar=
mor (+3). If your character chose to wear scaled armor, the weight cost wou=
ld be 6. Since 6 is greater than 5.5, take the difference of 5.5 - 6, which=
 equals -0.5. While the character is still able to add the full armor ratin=
g (+4) to their general armor, their defence will be decreased by 0.5 while=
 they&rsquo;re wearing it.</span></p><p class=3D"c3 c19"><span class=3D"c0"=
